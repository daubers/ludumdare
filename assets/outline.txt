Minimal Game

What are the bare essentials of a game?
 - Score
 - Player
 - Something to compete against?

Simple geometric space shooter?

Simple quiz type thing? - Boring!

Triangles vs Cubes/Circles?

The triangle rebellion has begun! All hail the 180's! The 360's suck!

Long has it been that the Triangles have been Mocked by the Circles and Squares for
containing pi radians and not the holy blessed 2pi radians.

The Triangles have long fought for equality amongst the Circles and Squares, but now
enough is enough! War has finally come to their universe.

Fight your way through the Circles and Squares to get to the Crossing of Line Segments, 
the ruler of the universe. Only it can revoke the laws of 2Pi.


--Collision Detection Plan--

There are only half a dozen tiles in total, so first look to see what the id of the tile
we're on is, then check to see if the point we're in on that tile is bounded or not.

Store boundings in a json file for now? Just load them all into memory with the detection
class.
